# lem-opengl

This is a frontend for lem. 
It is based on the ncurses frontend.
It renders lem to an OpenGL texture, making it easy to use in OpenGL enabled apps. 
Input and windowing is handled by [https://github.com/terminal625/sucle](https://github.com/terminal625/sucle) which is not yet available on quicklisp.
